<h1>Articulation test generator</h1>
This page is intended primarily for students at the University of
Sheffield taking EGH211 Phonetics: the selections generated are
indicative of the format and complexity of the articulation test at
the end of that module. The selections are made to ensure good
coverage of selected parts of the chart (pulmonic and non-pulmonic
consonants; primary and secondary cardinal vowels). You can
generate a new selection by clicking the <input type="button"
value="Make new selection"> button below.<br>
<br>
You can practice identifying the symbols, checking your answers
against the IPA chart. You can practice your production of the
corresponding sounds by working in pairs or small groups, or making
recordings of yourself and reviewing those. You can start by
producing consonants between two open vowels, and vowels on their
own. It may be helpful to refer to the clickable IPA chart with
video illustrations available from <a href=
"http://learnipa.group.shef.ac.uk/">the main <i>Learning the
International Phonetic Alphabet</i> page</a>.<br>
<br>
If IPA symbols seem to be absent this is probably because your
browser cannot access a Unicode font: see <a href=
"http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm">this
page</a> for advice on installing and using such fonts.<br>
