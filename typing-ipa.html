<h1>Including IPA symbols in documents</h1>
This page provides some general advice on including IPA symbols in
your documents.
<h2>Using an online clickable chart</h2>
This is perhaps the easiest method, and does not usually require
installing anything further. These sites provide clickable lists of
IPA symbols, allowing you to copy and paste the selected symbols
into your document.
<ul>
<li><a href=
"https://ipa.typeit.org/">https://ipa.typeit.org/</a></li>
<li><a href=
"http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/">http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing IPA fonts</h2>
There is a chance that your system already includes the resources
required to include IPA symbols in your documents. If not, or if
you have more advanced requirements, then you may need to install a
specialized IPA font.
<h3>For use with word processors</h3>
The <a href="https://www.sil.org">Summer Institute of
Linguistics</a> provides fonts which containing a full range of IPA
symbols for use with word processors:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://software.sil.org/charis/">Charis SIL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://software.sil.org/doulos/">Doulos SIL</a></li>
</ul>
There are versions of the fonts for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
<h3>For LaTeX</h3>
There is a concise explanation of the options available in <a href=
"https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/36547/110494">this post on
tex.stackexchange</a>; the options are also discussed in <a href=
"https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/224164/110494">this thread on the
same site</a>. If you go down the tipa route, you can download and
install the <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tipa">tipa package from
CTAN</a>. Note that this font does not include the symbol for the
labiodental flap; users might be able to make use of <a href=
"https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/144909/the-ipa-symbol-for-the-labiodental-flap-%E2%B1%B1">
this advice</a>. (If you are using Doulos SIL or Charis SIL then the symbol should be available.)
<h2>Inserting IPA symbols in a word processor</h2>
Due to the proliferation of different operating systems and word
processors, these suggestion might not apply in your specific
case.If you do not have Doulos SIL or Charis SIL installed (see
above) then you could try looking for IPA symbols in other fonts
e.g. Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman, Arial, Tahoma, Lucida Sans,
Lucida Grande. Remember that using an online clickable chart (see
above) provides a safe and convenient option in many cases.
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word:
<ul>
<li>Windows: go to the "Insert" menu, select "Symbol" from the menu
across the top of the screen (the ribbon), then "More Symbols...".
From the dropdown "Font" menu you can select Doulos SIL or Charis
SIL if you have them installed (see above); if you don't and can't
install them then try looking for the symbols in one of the fonts
listed above (Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman, Arial, Tahoma,
Lucida Sans, Lucida Grande). From the table of symbols which shows
up, scroll through, double click on the symbol you want to use and
it will be inserted into your document. (Changing the value of the
"Subset" dropdown menu may speed things up for you.) Repeat for any
other symbols. Close the "Symbol" dialogue box when you are
done.</li>
<li>Mac OS X: go to the "Insert" menu, select "Advanced Symbol"
from the menu across the top of the screen (the ribbon). From the
dropdown "Font" menu you can select Doulos SIL or Charis SIL if you
have them installed (see above); if you don't and can't install
them then try looking for the symbols in one of the fonts listed
above (Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman, Arial, Tahoma, Lucida
Sans, Lucida Grande). From the table of symbols which shows up,
scroll through, double click on the symbol you want to use and it
will be inserted into your document. Repeat for any other symbols.
Close the "Symbol" dialogue box when you are done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In LibreOffice (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux): go to the "Insert"
menu and select "Special character...". From the dropdown "Font"
menu you can select Doulos SIL or Charis SIL if you have them
installed (see above). From the table of symbols which shows up,
scroll through, double click on the symbol you want to use and it
will be inserted into your document. (Changing the value of the
"Subset" dropdown menu may speed things up for you.) Repeat for any
other symbols. Close the "Special Characters" dialogue box when you
are done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using AutoCorrect to speed up the inserting of symbols</h2>
If you find that you are typing the same IPA symbols often, you
might consider setting up an AutoCorrect function on your word
processor to replace certain keystrokes with IPA symbols.
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word:
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X: "Word" -&gt; "Preferences" -&gt; "AutoCorrect", then
in the "AutoCorrect" tab set a sequence of keys to be replaced by
an IPA symbol.</li>
<li>Windows: "File" -&gt; "Options" -&gt; "Proofing" -&gt;
"AutoCorrect Options...", then in the "AutoCorrect" tab set a
sequence of keys to be replaced by an IPA symbol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LibreOffice (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux): "Tools" -&gt;
"AutoCorrect" -&gt; "AutoCorrect options...", then in the "Replace"
tab set a sequence of keys to be replaced by an IPA symbol.</li>
</ul>
To use AutoCorrect across applications on Mac OS X: "System
Preferences" -&gt; "Keyboard", then in the "Text" tab tick/check
"Correct spelling automatically" and set a sequence of keys to be
replaced by an IPA symbol.
