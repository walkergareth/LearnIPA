<h1>Transcription test generator</h1>
This page is intended primarily for students at the University of
Sheffield taking EGH211 Phonetics: the selections generated are
indicative of the format and complexity of the transcription test
at the end of that module, where sounds will be produced 'live' for
you by a trained phonetician. The selections are made to ensure
good coverage of selected parts of the chart (pulmonic and
non-pulmonic consonants; primary and secondary cardinal
vowels).<br>
<br>
You can practice your production and perception of the sounds by
working in pairs or small groups, taking it in turns to produce and
transcribe the sounds. Produce the sounds in 1. between two open
vowels; produce the sounds in 2. on their own; produce the sounds
in each part of 3. as a fluent string of sounds with an open vowel
between the consonants; produce the sounds in each part of 4. as a
fluent string. You can also practice identifying the symbols,
checking your answers against the IPA chart. It may be helpful to
refer to the clickable IPA chart with video illustrations available
from <a href="http://learnipa.group.shef.ac.uk/">the main
<i>Learning the International Phonetic Alphabet</i> page</a>. You
can generate a new selection by clicking the <input type="button"
value="Make new selection"> button below.<br>
<br>
If IPA symbols seem to be absent this is probably because your
browser cannot access a Unicode font: see <a href=
"http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm">this
page</a> for advice on installing and using such fonts.<br>
